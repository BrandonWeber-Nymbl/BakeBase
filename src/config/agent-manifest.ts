BakeBase is optimized for AI agents building food, recipe, and culinary applications. CRITICAL: The /ingredients/combine endpoint is the most valuable - it performs actual chemistry calculations, not just data lookup. Chemistry fixes (Feb 2026): Now correctly counts ALL water sources in hydration calculations (not just >70% water ingredients), detects excessive leavening (>6% chemical, >4% biological), and eliminates contradictory texture predictions. When using /combine, provide ingredient IDs from the /ingredients list endpoint and quantities in grams. The analysis considers: hydration ratios (flour:liquid), leavening adequacy (chemical/biological/mechanical), protein interactions (gluten formation), fat content (tenderness), pH balance (acidity/alkalinity), and temperature sensitivity. Hydration ratio guide: <60% = dry dough (cookies, pie), 60-70% = bread dough, 70-100% = high hydration bread, >100% = batter (cakes, pancakes). All ingredient data sourced from USDA FoodData Central and peer-reviewed food science literature (confidence_level field indicates verification status). pH ranges are typical values and may vary by brand. For substitution recommendations, always consider the functional role in context. The database covers 60 ingredients optimized for common baking - not exotic or rare ingredients. Use /categories to discover ingredient structure before querying. Every response includes a 'meta' object with endpoint descriptions and field glossaries for self-documentation.",
